# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my responsive personal portfolio website built using **HTML** and **CSS** only.  
I initially generated the basic layout using **Lovable.ai**, and then I manually improved the structure, styling, and responsiveness.

## ✨ What I Modified Myself

- Updated all content with my personal details
- Added my **LinkedIn link** in the Connect section
- Added my **GitHub link** in the View Project button
- ❌ Removed JavaScript content that was initially generated

## 🔥 Tools & Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Lovable.ai
Thanks for checking out my project! 😊
